# img-abstractor
Program written in Python to make a Turtle paint an abstract painting from a user-specified image, inspired by Day 18 Project from 100 Days of Code but less abstract.
Bear in mind that I am a beginner and this program may seem rudimentary, I just made this to apply what I learned so far to make something I wanted.

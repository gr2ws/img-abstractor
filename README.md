# img-abstractor
Program written in Python to make a Turtle paint an abstract painting from a user-specified image, inspired by Day 18 Project from 100 Days of Code but less abstract.
Bear in mind that I am a beginner and this program may seem rudimentary, I just made this to apply what I learned so far to make something I wanted.
If paint is selected, a turtle will paint an abstract version of your image for you, with differing resolutions. Higher resolutions take exponentially more time.
Otherwise, text is outputted in the console. Text or ASCII mode now outputs decent looking images with the use of colored console output for the former and with 
some refactoring for the latter.

## how to use
* download the image you want to use. 
* manually crop the image so that it has a 1:1 ratio.
* place image in the "img" folder
* run main.py
* answer the prompts. you will be asked the name of the file and what to do with it.

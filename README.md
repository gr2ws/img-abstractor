# img-abstractor
Program written in Python to make a Turtle paint an abstract painting from a user-specified image, inspired by Day 18 Project from 100 Days of Code but less abstract.
Bear in mind that I am a beginner and this program may seem rudimentary, I just made this to apply what I learned so far to make something I wanted.
If paint is selected, a turtle will paint an abstract version of your image for you, with differing resolutions. Higher resolutions take exponentially more time.
Otherwise, text is outputted in the console. Text or ASCII mode may output a bad image, this is because my main objective was getting the Turtle to work, and I have not
gone beyond just getting the darkness and lightness of the image for these modes. Text mode may output really bad text in particular since the representation of darkness 
and lightness is limited.

## how to use
* download the image you want to use. 
* manually crop the image so that it has a 1:1 ratio.
* place image in the "img" folder
* run main.py
* answer the prompts. you will be asked the name of the file and what to do with it.
